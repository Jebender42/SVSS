"# SVSS" Standardized Visual Sound Spectrum

With this system we assign the 7 most distinguished colors of the light spectrum (ROYGBIV) to the musical notes Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Te

The use of Te(Bb) in stead of Ti(B Natural) for Violet happens so that Ti can hold a more pinkish hue as the scale transitions back around to a red Do

This system also uses Just Intonation and the Harmonic Series rather than Equal Temperament(12 Tet)

Do is associated with the Pitch Ratio 1

Re is 9/8

Mi is 5/4

Fa is 4/3

Sol is 3/2

La is 5/3

Te is 7/4

The next significant factor of this system is the innovative use of Brightness to determine Heighth and Depth of the note along the sound spectrum

The Lower the Note on the sound spectrum, the darker it appears

The Higher the Note on the sound spetrum, the lighter it appears

So that the Lowest note is totally Black

and the Highest note is totally White

So ultimately the system uses Hue to determine the Letter, Number, or Solfege note within a scale

and Brightness to determine how high or low the note is along the full sound spectrum

The system is then tempered so that the most Vibrant Colors of the Visual Light Spectrum fall on the most Vivacious Notes of the Harmonic Series

This system is intended to be utilized by Players, Theorists, Educators, Students, and Developers in order to cultivate a more intuitive relationship with the notes of the Sound Spectrum

It is also intended to be a Standardized and Globally Recognized system so that communication between Musicians is well established and understood
